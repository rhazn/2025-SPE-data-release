Integer anfangen und ggf. auf BIGINT updaten falls ein größerer Wert existiert) oder ob  - besonders weil man ja eigentlich über eine automatische Datenpipeline redet - dies während der Laufzeit passieren soll.","/"

Ich hatte zwischenzeitlich das Problem, dass gar keine Daten in die Sqlite-Tabelle geschrieben wurden, weil beim Konvertieren der Tabelle der Datentyp einer Spalte fehlerhaft war. Ich habe den Fehler dann zwar schnell gefunden (auch ohne das Debug-Flag), aber der fehlende Output hat mir zuerst suggeriert, dass eigentlich alles in Ordnung ist. Eine kurze Meldung am Ende des Laufs (z.B. ""X errors occurred"") würde diesem Missverständnis vorbeugen.
