--> Sobald ein RangeConstraint gesetzt wird, wird der Wert als Dezimal gesehen. Dies finde ich unschön, es sollte es Möglichkeit geben den Typ ""decimal"" oder ""integer"" auszuwählen, anstatt einfach immer decimal zu nehmen, weil so letztlich auch keine sinnvoll Validierung möglich ist (nur vollständige Werte)

block TemperaturesFilePicker oftype FilePicker {

Das Nutzen dieser Kombination gehört definitiv in die Dokumentation, ich fand es nicht gerade selbsterklärend anhand der Dokumentation.

- Die simple Transformation von decimal zu integer ist viel zu umständlich meiner Meinung nach

- Mittels remove soll entschieden werden können, ob die inputColumn entfernt werden soll nach der Transformation

- Über den TableInterpreter sollte es möglich sein die Spaltennamen zu ändern mittels  currentName --> newName oftype decimal.
Ob header true oder false ist dürfte egal sein bei der Implementierung des features
