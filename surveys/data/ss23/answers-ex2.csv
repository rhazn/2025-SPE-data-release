- I didn't use the right node version at the start, but once knowing that it is easy to fix. Maybe for more inexperienced users it would be nice if when running -jv and a error is encountered, jv itself could display a message saying please use node version > xy, you ran this with node version z
- I noticed that jv automatically considers rows that have ""gaps"", empty cells as faulty. I could think of cases where that would be undesired. (In some tables """" is used instead of 0 for instance) Is there a way to circumvent that default behavior then? I was just wondering.","- I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of use of jv and the good documentation. I think for someone who does not do much programming it will be fairly straight forward. It would be even more awesome if the documentation was somehow distributed with the VS plugin, so one can read it without leaving the IDE.
- maybe it would be possible to include a ""new file"" template for .jv files in the plugin that already has some sections like 
// Pipeline declaration (for the neat -> way to define it) 
// Valuetypes
// Constraints
// Blocks 
Also: I would be interested in what your idea is on a ""nice"" layout of a jv file. A style guideline, so to speak. You could possibly even distribute style rules along with the plugin (Indentation, free lines between blocks, "";"" after every instruction, etc.)."
