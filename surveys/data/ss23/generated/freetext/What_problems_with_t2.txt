# What problems with the programming language did you encounter during this exercise?

## Jayvee

The jv docu could be better structured and include a whole pipeline example like in the GitHub example folder
-----------
bin überrascht, da ich anfangs doch ziemlich skeptisch war, ob Jayvee überhaupt nötig ist, ist aber tatsächlich extrem einfach und schnell zu erlernen.
 
-----------
Not really a problem with the language, just some feedback.

- I didn't use the right node version at the start, but once knowing that it is easy to fix. Maybe for more inexperienced users it would be nice if when running -jv and a error is encountered, jv itself could display a message saying please use node version > xy, you ran this with node version z
- I noticed that jv automatically considers rows that have "gaps", empty cells as faulty. I could think of cases where that would be undesired. (In some tables "" is used instead of 0 for instance) Is there a way to circumvent that default behavior then? I was just wondering.

Mangelhafte Dokumentation von Jayvee. Kein richtiges Debuggen möglich wie in Python.
-----------
Sub-par developer experience
Javascript dependency
-----------
I was unsure about missing values. However, the exercise results are perfect so I am inclined to believe that it is correct. I suppose as long as we have a full score in the exercise, our grades are according to that.
-----------
Spent quite some time to look for a functionality to delete rows with empty fields.

## Python

Transformation part
-----------
Valid "IFOPT" values follow this pattern and setting SQL types
-----------
Datentypen richtig zuordnen
-----------
Unfamiliarity with pandas
-----------
it was hard to debug what was wrong with the regex
-----------
none
