# What problems with the programming language did you encounter during this exercise?

## Jayvee

Hi, nothing special. The exercise was pretty easy as it was 90% similar to one of the examples in the Javee documentation. The only problem I had was that for several times the HTTPExtracter couldn't fetch the zip file. But then it was OK. It said to check the internet connection, but internet was OK.

## Python

Using the urllib.request.urlretrieve tip it was rather straight forward. Most of the demanded transformations were already part of a previous exercise in some form and therefore easy to incorporate.
