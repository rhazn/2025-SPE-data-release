# What problems with the programming language did you encounter during this exercise?

## Jayvee

I found the CellRangeSelector and the  ColumnDeleter blocks to be not very intuitive. I first wanted to use the CellRangeSelector to select all necessary columns. I intuitively thought there would be a way to select all the required (non-adjacent) columns and I tried to delimit multiple ranges in one select with a comma, then a semicolon.
When none of this worked, I decided to read the documentation but found this topic to not be very well covered (linking related topics would help). Then decided to go through the Jayvee repository itself and found the RFCs, which were an amazing resource and went more into the depth of each topic and explained everything clearly. It would be great to incorporate some of the content into the documentation.

This led me to the realisation that I cannot do the task of selecting columns with CellRangeSelector as only adjacent cells can be selected and after exploring the option to use CompositeBlocks I decided to use the ColumnDeleter. Pleased to see that ColumnDeleter supports a collection of cell ranges, with my new knowledge of cell range syntax I designed the selections to delete multiple columns at once (like range A1:B*) only to find out that this is not supported. This constraint seemed quite artificial and meant that I had to manually select each column to be deleted, which was a huge pain in the butt.

The usual finding the right parameters for the job, like skipping the first lines or choosing the right encoding in the read_csv() function.
