The only problem I had was that for several times the HTTPExtracter couldn't fetch the zip file. But then it was OK. It said to check the internet connection, but internet was OK.","Extracting and picking file. It has a lot less boiler plate compared to python. And I feel data people really like this feature as they want these steps to work out of the box so that they  can focus on analysis part.

Also constraint was quiet similar. Easy and clean to set them. Really liked it."
