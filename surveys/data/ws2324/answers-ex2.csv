I wanted to provide some feedback on Exercise 2 and share a concern I encountered regarding the project structure.

However, I faced a challenge with the project structure. To enhance organization, I created a ""misc"" folder for global functions and constants related to the dataset and URL. While this structure works well locally, I noticed that when I use these defined constants or global functions from another folder in the exercise, the feedback indicates failure.

I suspect I might be making a mistake or there could be limitations in the workflow defined in the .yml file. I would appreciate any guidance or insights on how to structure my project to avoid this issue.

Additionally, I would like to discuss this matter further in our in-person meeting scheduled for December 6th. I believe your input will be invaluable in understanding and resolving this concern.

","Jayvee"
