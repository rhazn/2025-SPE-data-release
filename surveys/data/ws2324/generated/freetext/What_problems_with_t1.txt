# What problems with the programming language did you encounter during this exercise?

## Jayvee

Jayvee is a new programming language, therefore many things are still confusing to me, for example: I became confused when learning it from the resources you provided, and even after executing the script multiple times, I was unable to eliminate all of the issues. Then I used cars.jv and other examples as a reference for my exercise, and I was able to delete the inaccuracies as a result. I wasn't sure how much time I spent on the exercise, but I'm sure it took me many days to figure out the basics of Jayvee and other things.
-----------
I did not encounter any problems with this first exercise
-----------
Firstly combining the different Blocks in Jayvee that every block output serves as new input was bit unituitive combining to other programming languages.
-----------
It is pretty easy to follow, would be great if the documentation of Jayvee could show more examples. It should have taken me less time to solve the exercise, but I am generally new to VStudio and Github so the time spent somewhere apart from Jayvee itself. Would be great if I could use Jayvee in PyCharm etc. (Sorry that I am not very familiar with programming)
-----------
I wouldn't say problems since it was relatively easy exercise. But obviously coming from other programming languages, there is a learning curve to it.
-----------
there were some errors while runnign jayvee in the VS Code terminal had to manually use the windows terminal seperately to run the script
-----------
I did not faced any problem in coding but I faced some issue to install jayvee due to the node version issue. 

-----------
no debugging possibility found, would be nice to see some steps inbetween (e.g. for checking new value types) for  for example with the vscode plugin.
-----------
Had to set the delimeter which was bit confusing.
-----------
Understanding the code 
-----------
Right now all things going smoothly but in the future, I will get anything I am willing to share with you.
Need to make clear documentation.
I'm planning to make my project pipeline using Jayvee, I think I will face a real scenario in my project.
-----------
Debugging individual parts of pipeline and unavailability of helpful resources.
-----------
CSV interpreter can apply only one delimiter.I could not seperate multiple lines having different seperators.
-----------
Firstly difficulties in the setup but that was mainly due to the npm (having to change the version). Installing jayvee was straightforward. Also the YouTube video helped.

-----------
Installation, syntax
-----------
the VsCode extension needs improvements to give proper suggestions and there is little documentation available which needs to be improved
-----------
New form of programming, javee is new to me.
-----------
As Jayvee is new for me, I have to go through the documents first.
-----------
Its a quite new programming language but I need more documentation and support to learn more about this language. I know this is basic implementation to solve the exercises but I case in future i want use this language then it will great language.
-----------
Nothing. I just need some time to learn about it.
-----------
## Python

simply missing knowledge, I've felt not gaining from the lectures in advance. I preferer to talk about a topic first and then get the exercise and not the other way arround.
-----------
No Problem
-----------
Nothing wrong with python. It offers variety of libraries to do the work,
-----------
I started the implementation with help by the sqlalchemy v2 docs and had to change everything to v1, because the actions use an older version. In addition, the docs for sqlalchemy are very confusing.
-----------
To download the data, I thought, traditionally you establish a connection and then do a GET request to obtain the response from certail URI. So, I struggled with it. But then I googled a lot and found out the there is a nice function of pandas which handles it automatically. 

Apart from that everything went smooth for me.
-----------
-
-----------
With Python, no problems encountered. Maybe it just took me some time to realize that some steps can be done Pandas and not SQLAlchemy.
Also, enforcing specific Datatypes was not clear for me. As I had one run without changing or enforcing the Datatypes and I could see that the given Dataset has already the Desired Datatypes listed in the Exercise. But then I realized that for completeness purposes it would be better to enforce the Datatypes.

Also, the Git Test has been passed without the enforcmenet of the Datatypes.
-----------
No problems.
-----------
Python is easy to use  and because of the general freedom that one is given about the structure of the code (and in this case the pipeline) generally, the building of the pipeline was rather simple. BUT, I feel like building a structure that nicely represents a pipeline is harder, since I could not find a representing datastructure (could be my fault though). Consequently it is more or less just a sequential call of functions. One could cascade the function calls in each other to give a feel of a pipeline, but the resulting code could become a bit messy like this.
I am very interested how Jayvee code looks that solves the same problem and if the pipeline structure seems to be more present in the code itself.
-----------
mostly problems with technical setting. e.g. 1) python version in VS Code is older than the python version installed in system; 2) while importing the library such as SQLalchemy, VS Code said such module not found (something like this), tried long and couldn't solve it. but at the end it didn't matter, i could still use the library.
-----------
-- optionally was exploring incremental load ingestion with pandas, SQLalchemy libraries

-----------
None, but I already knew Python and Pandas. 
-----------
Getting Familiar with the packages
-----------
no problems, easy to use
