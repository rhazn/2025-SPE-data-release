Or TableTransformer should use a way to rename the column and not create a new one with a boolean. Like inplace=true. Also more inputs and more outputs can be adventagues if you have multiple columns you can modify with a single transform",""

The code block:
    transform CelsiusToFahrenheit {
        from Celsius oftype decimal;
        to Fahrenheit oftype decimal;
        Fahrenheit: (Celsius * 9/5) + 32;
    }

was not possible with a custom oftype. I wanted to make sure the temperatures where reasonable. It was still possible by checking the original Celsius values. It would be cool to support custom valuetypes in transforms. Maybe it is possible and I just couldn't figure it out :) 
I got the error message: The value needs to be of type ValidTemperature but is of type decimal.",""
