# What language features or libraries would have made solving the exercise easier?

## Jayvee

- Jayvee sollte in der Lage sein mittels keyword den optimalen Datentyp selbständig zu bestimmen:
 z.B.    "EVA_NR" oftype auto,




- I was pleasantly surprised by the ease of use of jv and the good documentation. I think for someone who does not do much programming it will be fairly straight forward. It would be even more awesome if the documentation was somehow distributed with the VS plugin, so one can read it without leaving the IDE.
- maybe it would be possible to include a "new file" template for .jv files in the plugin that already has some sections like 
// Pipeline declaration (for the neat -> way to define it) 
// Valuetypes
// Constraints
// Blocks 
Also: I would be interested in what your idea is on a "nice" layout of a jv file. A style guideline, so to speak. You could possibly even distribute style rules along with the plugin (Indentation, free lines between blocks, ";" after every instruction, etc.).
